## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: [1,3,5]
	Output: 1
	Example 2:
	
	Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
	Output: 0
	Note:

This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.

Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## solution


```c++

class Solution {
public:
	int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
		int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
		while (l <= r) {
			int mid = (l+r)/2;
			if (nums[mid] == nums[r]) {
				r--;
			}
			else if (nums[mid] > nums[r]) {
				l = mid + 1;
			}
			else {
				r = mid;
			}
		}
		return nums[l];
		//return min(nums[l], nums[r]);
	}
};
```
