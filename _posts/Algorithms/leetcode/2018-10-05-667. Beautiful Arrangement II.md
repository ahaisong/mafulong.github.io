Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

	Example 1:
	Input: n = 3, k = 1
	Output: [1, 2, 3]

Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.

	Example 2:
	Input: n = 3, k = 2
	Output: [1, 3, 2]

Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 

## solution
题目大意： 分配1-n,，让隔壁相差的数字有k个不同的

解法： 先分配1-(n-k)，然后剩下k+1个数字，从头从尾跳着来，就是一高一低这样

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
		vector<int> res;
		for (int i = 1; i < n - k; i++) {
			res.push_back(i);
		}
		for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
			if (i % 2 == 0) {
				res.push_back(n - k + i / 2);
			}
			else {
				res.push_back(n - i / 2);
			}
		}
		return res;
	}
};

```
