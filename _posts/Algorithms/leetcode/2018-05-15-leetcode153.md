[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

Output: 0

## solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=0,j=nums.size()-1;
        while(i<=j){
            int mid=(i+j)/2;
            if(i==j) return nums[mid];
            if(nums[mid]>nums[j]){
                i=mid+1;
            
            }else{
                j=mid;
            }
        }
        
    }
};
```
