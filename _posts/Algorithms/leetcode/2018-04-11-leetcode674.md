## Title
[the problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/description/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).
	
	Example 1:
	Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
	Output: 3

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

	Example 2:
	Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
	Output: 1

Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 

Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

题目大意:寻找数组最长连续增长子数组的长度

## Solution
```c++
//cpp:
class Solution {
public:
	int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
		if (nums.size() == 0)
			return 0;
		int len = 1;
		int maxn = 1;
		for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
			if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
				len++;
				maxn = max(maxn, len);
			}
			else {
				len = 1;
			}
		}
		return maxn;
	}
};
```
