---
## Title
[the problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

	Example 1:
	Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
	Output: 3

Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.

The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Note:

The input array will only contain 0 and 1.

The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

## Solution
获得最大连续长度

```c++
//cpp:
class Solution {
public:
	int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
		int maxn, t;
		t = 0;
		maxn = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
			if (nums[i] == 1) {
				t++;
			}
			else {
				t = 0;
			}
			maxn = max(maxn, t);
		}
		return maxn;
	}
};
```
